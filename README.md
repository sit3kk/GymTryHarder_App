## ![Patterns Icon](URL_TO_PATTERNS_ICON) **Design Patterns:**

### ![MVC Icon](URL_TO_MVC_ICON) **MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER (MVC):**
**Use Case:** Organizing your code in a way that separates data handling, user interface rendering, and control flow.
**Example:** Models could represent data structures for users and workouts, views could render user profiles and workout plans, and controllers could handle user inputs like creating a new workout plan.

### ![Singleton Icon](URL_TO_SINGLETON_ICON) **SINGLETON:**
**Use Case:** Ensuring a class has only a single instance and providing a global point of access to that instance.
**Example:** Managing a single database connection pool to ensure efficient database access across your app.

### ![Factory Icon](URL_TO_FACTORY_ICON) **FACTORY:**
**Use Case:** Creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
**Example:** Creating workout plan objects where different types of workout plans (e.g., strength training, cardio, mixed) may have different properties and behaviors.

### ![Decorator Icon](URL_TO_DECORATOR_ICON) **DECORATOR:**
**Use Case:** Adding new functionality to an object without altering its structure.
**Example:** Extending the functionalities of API endpoints, like adding authentication checks or input validation without modifying the existing code structure.

### ![Observer Icon](URL_TO_OBSERVER_ICON) **OBSERVER:**
**Use Case:** Allowing an object to publish changes to its state so that other objects can react accordingly.
**Example:** Notifying users of new social interactions like friend requests, comments, or shared achievements in real-time.

### ![Strategy Icon](URL_TO_STRATEGY_ICON) **STRATEGY:**
**Use Case:** Allowing a family of algorithms to be defined and encapsulated within a class. The algorithm can be selected at runtime.
**Example:** Allowing users to switch between different workout recommendation algorithms based on their preferences and goals.
